#+TITLE: dwm-with-viewers
#+AUTHOR: Tony

A tiny playground for ricing **dwm** (and friends) together. Try patches, share themes/snippets, and open PRs with your changes.

* Quick Start (Arch Linux)
Install the deps (beyond ~base~ / ~base-devel~):
#+begin_src sh
sudo pacman -S --needed \
  libx11 libxft libxinerama pkgconf \
  libxrandr libxrender harfbuzz imlib2 zlib   # (optional; patch-dependent)
#+end_src

Build (from a component directory, e.g. ~dwm/~ or ~dmenu/~):
#+begin_src sh
make clean && make
# install (system-wide)
sudo make install
#+end_src

* Nix Dev Shell (optional)
If you have Nix, you can hack without touching system packages:
#+begin_src sh
# from repo root
nix develop           # or: nix develop .#dwm / .#dmenu / .#st
make clean && make
#+end_src
The dev shell exports the right ~INCS~/~LIBS~ so upstream Makefiles “just work”.

* Contributing
- Fork → create a branch → open a PR (screenshots/gifs are welcome).
- Keep patches focused (one idea per PR).
- If your change needs extra libs, note the Arch package names and add them to the flake dev shell if relevant.

* Notes
- Some patches (e.g., harfbuzz, xrender, graphics) require the optional libs listed above.
- You can test locally before installing by adjusting ~PREFIX~ (e.g., ~make PREFIX=$HOME/.local install~).
